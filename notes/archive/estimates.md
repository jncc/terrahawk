Dark Peak (run on Felix's machine) - a reduced-size frame
---------------------------------------------------------

4312 polygons input (spatial framework) - but some are filtered out due to no data ??
4227 unique polygons in subset according to GGIS ??
4182 polygons actually computed
5 indexes (S2 only run)
20910 rows in DB - 5.1MB

=> 243.902439 bytes per row in SQLite

Other databases that Cathy has created:
453694 rows in DB - 103MB
1528858 rows in DB - 351MB

So one polygon generates

We actually need 7 indexes.
Current Ceda archive has 1600 S2, 90 S1 scenes (but need to split into frames)

# how are we recording dates - seperate rows?
