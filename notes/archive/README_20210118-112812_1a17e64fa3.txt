Indices were calculated by JNCC from analysis-ready Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data processed by JNCC and Defra.  This project was funded by the Caroline Herschel Framework Partnership Agreement on Copernicus User Uptake.

A polygon is flagged as different from the mean if in a month or season if its value for a given index (NDVI, NDWI, NDMI, RVI, RVIv) and statistic (mean, median, 1st quartile, 3rd quartile) is more than 1 standard deviation different from the habitat level mean value for the given index and statistic.

This csv contains 21 fields as follows:
PolygonID        - polygon unique identifier
LE_ID            - Living England polygon identifier
Index            - selected index
TimePeriod       - time period
Habitat          - habitat
AcquisitionDates - cloud and shadow free imagery acquisition dates for that polygon, within the specified time period
Mean             - mean index value
MeanDiff         - how many standard deviations different is this polygon from the habitat level mean of mean index value
HabitatMean      - mean of polygon mean index value for all polygons of this habitat type
HabitatMean_SD   - standard deviation of polygon mean index value for all polygons of this habitat type
Median           - median index value
MedianDiff       - how many standard deviations different is this polygon from the habitat level mean of median index value
HabitatMedian    - mean of polygon median index value for all polygons of this habitat type
HabitatMedian_SD - standard deviation of polygon median index value for all polygons of this habitat type
Q1               - index value first quartile
Q1Diff           - how many standard deviations different is this polygon from the habitat level mean of index value 1st quartile
HabitatQ1        - mean of polygon index value 1st quartile for all polygons of this habitat type
HabitatQ1_SD     - standard deviation of polygon index value 1st quartile for all polygons of this habitat type
Q3               - index value third quartile
Q3Diff           - how many standard deviations different is this polygon from the habitat level mean of index value 3rd quartile
HabitatQ3        - mean of polygon index value 3rd quartile for all polygons of this habitat type
HabitatQ3_SD     - standard deviation of polygon index value 3rd quartile for all polygons of this habitat type
