Meeting 2021-01-26
==================

- What are the deliverables / timescales?
- Started with {jp}'s user flow and looked at the existing app with {ih}] and {bt}.
- These overlap but the are new bits in Jon's and inevitably existing subtleties that aren't captured
- Tried to take the superset - an imagined app
- This functionality implies an API - in other words, SOMETHING THAT PROVIDES THE DATA THE APP NEEDS TO WORK
- The API implies a data store - presumably (but not necessarily) a spatial database
- So I've been trying to define what this API and data store would need to look like.
- We have an awesome pilot app. Exciting, fits our combined skills.
- We have dev, web map experience, Jasmin processing, ARD, EO and habitat data specialists - this is us!
- In particular we have a recent application (SRSP) so a lot of this will use tech from that

- Met with Felix, Izzy, Gwawr and Becky -> missing stats step
- Understand the task is "upscaling" - Yorkshire?
- config.yaml - fundamentally, upscaling means removing this file in some way.
- There are lots of manually / baked-in things that need to be genericised
- But also in particular: the Site problem!
  - The proof-of-concept is *implicitly site-based*.
  - Are sites fundamentally part of the system, or not?
